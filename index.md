# About Me
Hi, this is **Linjia Tang (Alex)**.<br>

I am a undergraduate student in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. 

Last year, I have conducted this research under the supervision of Prof. [Sihang Liu](https://www.sihangliu.com/). 

Currently, I am currently participating in two part-time research projects:

The RNA-small molecule binding affinity project which is supervised by Principal Scientist [Wu Min](https://sites.google.com/site/wumincf/) of A*STAR in Singapore.

The Medical Image Generation project which is supervised by Ph.D. student [Jasper Zhang](https://jasperzhang.com/) of the University of Toronto and the University Health Network.
